Ques 3 - How to send security token in axios get request



const config = {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
};

const bodyParameters = {
   key: "value"
};

Axios.post( 
  'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/get_token_payloads',
  bodyParameters,
  config
).then(console.log).catch(console.log);
The first parameter is the URL.
The second is the JSON body that will be sent along your request.
The third parameter are the headers (among other things). Which is JSON as well.



Ques 4 - How to create class component in React JS?


When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.

The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

ExampleGet your own React.js Server
Create a Class component called Car

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns a <h2> element.

To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: <Car />

Example
Display the Car component in the "root" element:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);
